# Parking Slot Availability Detection System Based on Arduino Uno

## Introduction

By integrating sensors with Arduino Uno we designed and implemented a system architecture to accurately detect and ensure real-time parking slot availability.

## System Specifications

Microcontroller : Arduino Uno

Components      :- Button
                 - LCD 12x16
                 - Buzzer 95DB 12V
                 - Servo
                 - Infrared Sensor FC-51
                 - Ultrasonic Sensor

## Working Principles
Arduino Uno controls various I/O, the infrared Sensor FC-51 is used as input to detect cars, the Button is used as a trigger to turn on the emergency signal, and the Ultrasnoic Sensor is used to detect cars at the entrance and exit, while for output it uses a 12x16 LCD to display information sent from the infrared sensor, the 95DB 12V buzzer and the final Servo to open and close the portal door.

## Installation and Setup
   1. Hardware Setup
      - Connect the Arduino Uno to LCD, Buzzer, Infrared Sensor FC-51, Ultrasonic Sensor.
        
   2. Software Setup
      - Install the Arduino IDE
      - Upload the Arduino code that has been created according to your needs to the Arduino Uno.
